### University of Glasgow 

<p>Between September 2018 and July 2019, I developed a mixed-methods project investigating the conceptual representation of food as stored in simulations based on previous eating experience, expanding on the research of <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/estherpapies/">Esther Papies</a>, and supervised by <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/maxineswingler/">Maxine Swingler</a>. The first phase of this study investigated factors affecting the level of imagery experienced during the conceptualisation of different foods.</p>

&nbsp;

The second phase of this study utilised qualitative data gathered from 8 semi-structured interviews. Three major themes were identified as important to the experience and formation of eating simulations: motivation, experience, and reward.

### University of Twente
<p>From June to August 2017, I undertook an Erasmus summer internship at the University of Twente, working in the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/pcrv/">Psychology of Conflict, Risk, and Safety</a> department. There I worked with two other Erasmus students to develop a project investigating linguistic indicators of online deception in modern instant messaging platforms, under the supervision of <a href="https://people.utwente.nl/m.stel">Dr. Marielle Stel</a>. In order to investigate this, participants were paired into whatsapp groups anonymously, and asked to solve the Desert Survival problem. In this hypothetical scenario, participants are told to imagine their aeroplane had crashed in the desert, and they had a list of 15 salvageable items to help ensure their survival (such as water, a pistol, and  waterproof clothing). They were instructed to reach a consensual ranking from most to least important in terms of survival value. In this study, participants in the experimental condition were designated to the deceiver condition, and were briefed on different deception strategies, and tasked with giving counterproductive advice in order to ultimately sabotage the survival attempt. Participant word count, use of informal language, and emoji use was analysed.</p>

<p>This research was capitalised on and further developed by [Michelle Walther](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellewalther), Masters student in the Psychology of Conflict, Risk and Safety department at Twente, and is currently being submitted for publication.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>During my internship at Twente, I also assisted in producing materials for  <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/marco-van-bommel-745a5b60">Dr Marco Van Bommel</a> in an attempt to expand upon his [previous work](https://essay.utwente.nl/72614/1/Huxoll_BA_BMS.pdf) investigating the effects of sexual harassment experience through the medium of virtual reality. Factors such as the location where the harassment takes place, the sex of the harasser, and the level of harasser aggression were manipulated while filming the materials.</p>

### University of Strathclyde 
<p>For my undergraduate dissertation, I developed a study investigating explanations for the Weapon Focus effect in eyewitness testimony, supervised by <a href="https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/stephen-kelly">Dr Steven Kelly</a>.</p>
<p>The weapon focus effect, defined as a drop in memory performance for a scene caused by the presence of a weapon, has been explained through two hypotheses: The arousal/threat hypothesis attributes the weapon focus effect effect to attentional narrowing caused by physiological stress, whereas the unusual item hypothesis claims the memory deficit arises from difficulty processing objects schematically incongruent for their context, which causes them to draw more attention at memory encoding, at the expense of memory for other details. These explanations were investigated using a 2 x 2 independent measures design, manipulating threat and item unusualness.</p>
